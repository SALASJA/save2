## Course Description

In a world with ever increasing data generated both by humans and machines alike, the field of computer science has seen a transition from computation-intensive solutions to data-intensive ones. Often in such a scenario, solutions to real-world problems can be derived/learned by analyzing disparate, complex and messy datasets using Data Science methods and approaches.

This course is highly interactive, and will explore the theories, techniques, and the tools necessary to gain insights from such datasets. Using a problem-based learning philosophy, students are expected to make use of such technologies to design data solutions that can process and analyze real-world datasets for a variety of scientific, social, and environmental challenges.

The core topics addressed by the course will be:

- Programming with Data
- Data Mining, Munging, Wrangling
- Statistics, Analytics, Representation, Visualization
- Introduction to Applied Machine-Learning

## Prerequisites
CSC 339 (Programming Languages) OR Programming experience (Instructor Permission Required)

## Textbooks
There is no required text for the course. Class slides will be available for download. Suggested textbooks are: 1) Building Machine Learning Systems with Python (Richert and Coelho), 2) Data Science from Scratch (Joel Grus)

## Course Overview
This course is highly interactive and based on the problem-based learning philosophy; students are expected to make use of said technologies to design highly scalable systems that can process and analyze real-world datasets for a variety of scientific, social, and environmental challenges.

The core topics addressed by the course will be:
* Data Science and its applications
* Data-Mining and its methods on large data-sets
* Machine-Learning on real world data-sets and its applicability

  - **3 - Meets Criteria:** Satisfactory organization; clear introduction; main points are well stated; some transitions are somewhat sudden. Clear conclusion.
  - **2 - Progressing to Criteria:** Information is somewhat organized. Audience may have difficulty following presentation in areas.
  - **1 - Below Expectations:** Presentation is unorganized. Introduction unclear. Audience has difficulty following presentation. Presentation contains abrupt jumps; some of the main points and conclusion are unclear.

## Academic Honesty Policy

The instructor will deal strictly with any violations of academic honesty and integrity in this course. See Academic Integrity Policy ([Link](https://osrr.uncg.edu/academic-integrity/)).  for more details. ***Absolutely no discussion, collaboration, copying, and sharing on assignments. This includes coping from the internet. Any student who violates this policy will receive “F” in the course. The instructor will report the case to the university.***

## Attendance Policy
Attendance is required for all the class meetings. If you will be absent for any class it is your responsibility to catch up on class materials.


## Special Needs and/or Disabilities
Students with disabilities should have documentation from the Office of Accessibility Resources & Services ([Link](https://ods.uncg.edu/)). This documentation should be provided to the instructor for review. In the case of major provisions such as separate testing environment or test-readers, the student must make arrangements with Office of Accessibility Resources & Services so that suitable accommodations can be provided.
